  More students than ever are faced with the challenge of becoming good
  programmers, but this process takes time and requires learning from a

  this process using artificial intelligence, to create a kind of virtual
  mentor that can make suggestions to aspiring programmers based on the
  patterns and best practices that it has found in a collection of examples.
