  \subsection{Single Input Network}
  \label{sub:single_input_network}
  
    Using the aforementioned parameter pair, we trained another network to make predictions based on
    a single input token. The loss settled after three epochs so we decided to abort early.

    We then ran a selection of input words through the network and sorted the output vector indices
    based on their corresponding values. Then we selected the first five of them, meaning the five
    best guesses the network would make. The results are depicted in (\ref{tab:singleres}).
    
    \begin{table}[htpb]
      \centering
      \label{tab:singleres}
      \begin{tabular}{l | l | l | l | l}
        \textbf{Input} & \verb+if+ & \verb+import+ & \verb+def+ & \verb+(+ \\ \hline  
        \textbf{Prediction}  &  \verb+<ID>+ &\verb+<ID>+  & \verb+<ID>+ & \verb+<ID>+ \\
          & \verb+not+ & \verb+sys+ & \verb+__init__+ & \verb+self+ \\
          & \verb+self+ & \verb+os+ & \verb+main+ & \verb+0+ \\
          & \verb+__name__+ & \verb+time+ & \verb+get+ & \verb+1+ \\
          & \verb+len+ & \verb+random+ & \verb+close+ & \verb+x+ \\
      \end{tabular}
      \caption{Predictions made by the single input network}
    \end{table}

    These results look very promising as it makes indeed a lot of sense that words like
    \verb+if+ or \verb+import+ are usually followed directly by an identifier. We can also
    see that common Python imports like \verb+import sys+ or \verb+import os+ are important
    enough to the network that it considers them helpful suggestions. This is exactly
    the kind of behavior that we were looking for.
