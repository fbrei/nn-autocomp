# NN Autocomp

A neural network based auto completion engine.

This is currently just a Jupyter notebook and is only tested with Python code. It should be easy to adapt though, so knock yourself out :)

The requirements.txt file contains everything to run this notebook, so just

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

(preferrably inside a conda environment).

Have fun!
